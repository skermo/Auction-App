          You can access and use the Website and Services without telling us who
          you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify
          you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to
          use some of the features offered on the Website, you may be asked to
          provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and
          e-mail address).
        </p>
        <p>
          We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when
          you create an account, publish content, or fill any forms on the
          Website. When required, this information may include the following:
        </p>
        <ul>

        <p>
          You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but
          then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features on
          the Website. Users who are uncertain about what information is

          We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children
          under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not
          submit any Personal Information through the Website and Services. If
          you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has
          provided Personal Information to us through the Website and Services,
          please contact us to request that we delete that child&#8217;s
          Personal Information from our Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their
          children&#8217;s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by
          instructing their children never to provide Personal Information
          through the Website and Services without their permission. We also ask
          that all parents and legal guardians overseeing the care of children
          take the necessary precautions to ensure that their children are
          instructed to never give out Personal Information when online without
          their permission.

          We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling
          Personal Information, unless we have entered into a data processing
          agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and
          we would be the data processor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving
          Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data controller when
          we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to
          ensure your access and use of the Website and Services. In such
          instances, we are a data controller because we determine the purposes
          and means of the processing of Personal Information.
        </p>
        <p>
          We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you
          submit Personal Information through the Website and Services. We do
          not own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal
          Information, and such Personal Information is processed only in
          accordance with your instructions. In such instances, the User
          providing Personal Information acts as a data controller.

        <p>
          In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet
          a legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal
          Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we
          may not be able to provide you with the requested products or
          services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for
          the following purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
          <li>Send product and service updates</li>

          <li>Request user feedback</li>
          <li>Enforce terms and conditions and policies</li>
          <li>Protect from abuse and malicious users</li>

          <li>Run and operate the Website and Services</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with
          the Website and Services, where you are located in the world and if
          one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one
          or more specific purposes; (ii) provision of information is necessary
          for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any
          pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for
          compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv)
          processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public
          interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v)
          processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
          pursued by us or by a third party.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process
          information until you object to such processing by opting out, without
          having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases. In any
          case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that
          applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of
          Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a
          requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

          You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you.
          The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Website and
          Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may
          maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records
          for the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to our
          affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below. If you

          unaffiliated third parties.

          Service Providers are not authorized to use or disclose your
          information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or
          comply with legal requirements. Service Providers are given the

          We may also disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or
          receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a
          subpoena or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith
          that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your
          safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a
          government request.

        <h2 id="retention-of-information">Retention of information</h2>
        <p>
          We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period
          necessary to comply with our legal obligations, as long as your user
          account remains active, to enforce our agreements, resolve disputes,
          and unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your
          Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a
          manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period
          expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right
          to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the
          right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of
          the retention period.

          Our Website and Services may use third-party analytics tools that use
          cookies, web beacons, or other similar information-gathering
          technologies to collect standard internet activity and usage
          information. The information gathered is used to compile statistical
          reports on User activity such as how often Users visit our Website and
          Services, what pages they visit and for how long, etc. We use the
          information obtained from these analytics tools to monitor the
          performance and improve our Website and Services. We do not use
          third-party analytics tools to track or to collect any personally
          identifiable information of our Users and we will not associate any

        <h2 id="do-not-track-signals">Do Not Track signals</h2>
        <p>
          Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to
          websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity
          tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information
          in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to
          collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use
          or visit a website or online service as they move across different
          websites over time. The Website and Services do not track its visitors
          over time and across third-party websites. However, some third-party
          websites may keep track of your browsing activities when they serve
          you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.

          is issued by the operating system of your device. While it is possible
          to access a list of device tokens, they will not reveal your identity,
          your unique device ID, or your contact information to us. We will

          We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled,
